## Beer is Food

When I say beer is food, what I mean is that it is not only a food product, but it is food for the soul. Beer has been a cornerstone of civilization pretty much from the start. We believe the ancient Babalonyans began brewing the first beers around 12,000 years ago and it has been refined for generation after generation to the beer we have today. Some historians believe that the discovery of beer is one of the major contributing factors of why agriculture developed back then. [You can read more about the history of beer here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer) Not only is beer a food, it is also an art and a science. Just like professional chefs at 5 star restaurants create artwork with their food, brewers create artwork with their beer through its visual, aeromatic, and flavor profiles. This is all achieved through the rigirous use of scientific methodologies such as sanitation, temperature control, yeast cultivation, and enzomatic converstion of sugars.

As a homebrewer I have a few books that I have used that have helped me in brewing better beer. The first book I would recommend to a new homebrewer is "How to Brew" by John Palmer. He gives an amazing guide to the new and seasoned homebrewer how to start brewing beer at a basic level, all the way up to some of the most complex methods and systems of brewing. In fact an older edition of his book is available free online at his website: [How to Brew](http://howtobrew.com/book/) The second book I would recommend is "Designing Great Beers" by Ray Daniels. This book gives the homebrewer a fantastic guide of what ingredients and techniques are needed in order to brew the many different styles of beer at the homebrewer level. The last book I would recommend is "Brewing Classic Styles" by Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer. This book will give the homebrewer over 80 recipies of various styles that are award winning beers at the National Homebrewer's Conference competition.
