# My Childhood Dream: Flight

Growing up I always wanted to be a fighter pilot in the Air Force. I can still remember the moment that made me want to be one. I was about 7 years old and my family and I went to the 4th of July fair in downtown St. Louis. Each year they have an airshow and this particular year they had a showcase of the Harrier Jumpjet. I remember watching this fighter jet come flying in from the distance, come to a stop over the Mississippi river underneath the Arch and hover. It was loud, so loud that almost everyone around me was plugging their ears. I stood there in amazement fully immersed in the power, the vibrations, and the sound of such a beautiful machine. In that moment I made up my mind that was what I wanted to do.

Sadly, things did not pan out that way, but my love for flying has not deminished in the slightest. I still get giddy inside when I fly to this day. While I haven't had the resources to be able to take flying lessons yet, I know that will be one of the first things I do when I graduate and get a job working in IT. My dream is to one day own my own acrobatic airplane and spend my free time flying.

Here are some images of my favorite airplanes:
