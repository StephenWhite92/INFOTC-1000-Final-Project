# Gaming

Some of my favorite games are roguelikes. Currently I am playing For the King as much as possible when I do play games. Other roguelikes I have played a lot of are: FTL: Faster Than Light, Binding of Issac, Dungeons of Dreadmor, Darkest Dungeon, and Risk of Rain 2. I love the challenge of these games as well as the hardcore aspect of them. I also like the replayability of the games as each new game save is completely different from the last. They are difficult, but it is extremely rewarding to beat the game after having failed many many times.

Here is a picture of my PC that I use for gaming on:

As you can tell, I take my gaming very seriously.
