**Beer is Food**

When I say beer is food, what I mean is that it is not only a food product, but it is food for the soul. Beer has been a cornerstone of civilization pretty much from the start. We believe the ancient Babalonyans began brewing the first beers around 12,000 years ago and it has been refined for generation after generation to the beer we have today. Some historians believe that the discovery of beer is one of the major contributing factors of why agriculture developed back then.
