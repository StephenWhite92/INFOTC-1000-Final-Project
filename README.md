Hello, my name is Stephen White and I am a 28 year old working toward a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology from the University of Missouri - Columbia. I am attending classes full time in order to achive his degree.
I also work full time at a local grocery store and have been with them for almost 9 and a half years. In that time I have held many postions:

* Customer Service Clerk and Substitute Overnight Manager for 4 years.
* Overnight Manager for 2.5 years.
* Customer Service Manager for .5 years.
* Center Store Lead/Period Inventory Clerk for 1 year.

In my limited free time I like to play videogames, listen to podcasts, and brew my own beer. I also am a passionate St. Louis Blues fan.
My favorite genres of videogames are roguelikes, racing games, single player first person shooters, and role playing games. You can see more about my favorite genre of games as well as my gaming PC [here.](Gaming.md)
I began brewing beer in 2018 and I work to brew better beer each time I do so. My favorite styles of beer to drink and brew are IPAs (India Pale Ales), Belgian Tripels, Pale Ales, and Porters. You can read more about my passion for brewing and the resources I use [here.](Brewing.md)

Because I am going into IT here is a link to a Scalable Vector Graphic code that I created as part of this class. [Blues](Blues)

Lastly, I want to express my passion for flying and you can read more about that [here](Flying.md)
